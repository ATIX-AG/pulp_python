Sync is no longer available at the {remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href} endpoint. Instead, use POST {repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href}.

Creating / listing / editing / deleting python repositories is now performed on /pulp/api/v3/python/python/ instead of /pulp/api/v3/repositories/. Only python content can be present in a python repository, and only a python repository can hold python content.
