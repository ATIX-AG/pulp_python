pulp-python Plugin
==================

The ``pulp_python`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`_ to support
hosting pip compatible Python packages like the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_.

How to use these docs
---------------------

The documentation here should be considered **the primary documentation for managing Python
content**. See `How to navigate the pulpcore and plugin docs
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/index.html#how-to-navigate-the-pulpcore-and-plugin-docs>`_
for a more thorough explanation.

All relevent workflows are covered here, with references to pulpcore supplemental docs. Users may
also find `pulpcore's conceptual docs <https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/concepts.html>`_
helpful. Here, the documentation falls into two main categories:

  1. :ref:`workflows-index` show the **major features** of the Python plugin, with links to reference
     docs.
  2. `REST API Docs <restapi.html>`_ are automatically generated and are responsible for containing
     thorough information for each **minor feature**, including all fields and options.
