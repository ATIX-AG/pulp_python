pulp-python 3.0 Release Notes
=============================

pulp-python 3.0 is currently in Beta. Backwards incompatible changes
might be made until Beta is over.

3.0.0b4
=======

* Adds support for `pulpcore 3.0.0.rc1 <https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/release-notes/pulpcore/3.0.x.html#rc1>`_.

* Adds excludes support (aka 'blacklist')

  Renames the "projects" field on the remote to "includes".

  Adds a new "excludes" field to the remote which behaves like "includes", except that any specified
  releasees or digests are not synced, even if an include specifier matches them.

  Also adds a 'prereleases' field to the remote, which toggles whether prerelease versions should be
  synced. This mirrors the 'prereleases' flag that packaging.specifiers.SpecifierSet provides.

* Removes Python 3.5 support
