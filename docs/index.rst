pulp-python Plugin
==================

The ``pulp_python`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`_ to support
hosting pip compatible Python packages similarly to the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/>`_.

How to use these docs
---------------------

The documentation here should be considered **the primary documentation for managing Python
content**. All relevent workflows are covered here, with references to some pulpcore supplemental
docs. Users may also find `pulpcore's conceptual docs
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/concepts.html>`_ useful. Here, the documentation falls
into two main categories:

  1. :ref:`workflows-index` show the **major features** of the Python plugin, with links to reference
     docs.
  2. `REST API Docs <../restapi.html>`_ are automatically generated and provide more detailed
     information for each **minor feature**, including all fields and options.
