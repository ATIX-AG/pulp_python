pulp-python Plugin
==================

The `python`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/>`__ to support
hosting python packages. This plugin is a part of the `Pulp Project
<http://www.pulpproject.org>`_, and assumes some familiarity with the `pulpcore documentation
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/>`_.

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the :doc:`basic
workflows<workflows/index>`.

The REST API documentation for ``pulp_python`` is available `here <restapi.html>`_.

Tech Preview
------------

backwards incompatible changes will be introduced for these particular features.  For a list of

<tech-preview>`.

How to use these docs
=====================

The documentation here should be considered the **primary documentation for managing Python related content.**
All relevent workflows are covered here, with references to some pulpcore supplemental docs.
Users may also find pulpcoreâ€™s conceptual docs useful.

This documentation falls into two main categories:

    1. :ref:`workflows-index` shows the **major features** of the Python plugin, with links to reference docs.
    2. The `REST API Docs <restapi.html>`_ are automatically generated and provide more detailed information for each
       minor feature, including all fields and options.
