# Overview

The `` python` `` plugin extends [pulpcore](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/) to support
hosting python packages. This plugin is a part of the [Pulp Project](http://www.pulpproject.org), and assumes some familiarity with the [pulpcore documentation](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/).

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the {doc}`basic
workflows<workflows/index>`.

The REST API documentation for `pulp_python` is available [here](restapi.html).

## Features

- `Create local mirrors of PyPI <sync-workflow>` that you have full control over
- `Upload your own Python packages <uploading-content>`
- `Perform pip install ` from your Pulp Python repositories
- `Download packages on-demand <create-remote>` to reduce disk usage
- Every operation creates a restorable snapshot with `Versioned Repositories <versioned-repo-created>`
- Curate your Python repositories with allowed and disallowed packages
- Host content either [locally or on S3](https://docs.pulpproject.org/installation/storage.html)
- De-duplication of all saved content

## Tech Preview

Some additional features are being supplied as a tech preview.  There is a possibility that
backwards incompatible changes will be introduced for these particular features.  For a list of
features currently being supplied as tech previews only, see the {doc}`tech preview page
<tech-preview>`.

# How to use these docs

The documentation here should be considered the **primary documentation for managing Python related content.**
All relevant workflows are covered here, with references to some pulpcore supplemental docs.
Users may also find pulpcoreâ€™s conceptual docs useful.

This documentation falls into two main categories:

> 1. `workflows-index` shows the **major features** of the Python plugin, with links to reference docs.
> 2. The [REST API Docs](restapi.html) are automatically generated and provide more detailed information for each
>    minor feature, including all fields and options.
